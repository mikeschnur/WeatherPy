# WeatherPy

Using Python APIs to pull weather data for an app to display the weather in cities in which the app user will travel. The beta testers of this app also requested for their users to have the ability to choose their minimum and maximum temperatures for their trip. After the four cities were chosen an itinerary map was created with pins and markers to describe the cities.

## Process

A DataFrame was created to list all of the potential travel destinations.
